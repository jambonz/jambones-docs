Geraint Thomas was going jambones on that descent! Overview There are a lot of CPAAS providers on the market today, and they all provide the same thing: A set of easy-to-use APIs that allow enterprises to manage their communication services in new and innovative ways. So then. Why do we need (yet another) CPAAS? Well, since you asked.. jambonz differs from other solutions because it is: a) open source . Oh, and we mean completely open source (none of that \"yes, we have open source, but you really need to think about upgrading to our commercial offering if you're going to be serious about this relationship\", haha). All of the jambonz core software and drachtio is available under the MIT License . b) a self-hosted solution: You run it on your own infrastructure. Use your own SIP trunks. Your own storage. Your own cloud speech credentials. Why pay someone to upcharge you for all of that when it's basically a one-click experience to provision all of those yourself in today's world. You know how to click, right? Let's put it this way: ask yourself -- what are you really getting of value from that fancy-pants CPAAS service you're paying for, when you take away all of the integrations that you can easily do yourself? Just a nice API and application processing engine, that's what. So why not get your own telephony API engine (hint, hint: that's jambonz!) and bring your own everything else to the party? Just sayin. c) a radical approach to privacy . None of your customer's personally identifiable information (PII) is stored at rest within the jambonz platform itself. Ever. Recordings or transcriptions that might contain sensitive information such as credit card numbers, HIPAA-related information, or social security numbers are neever stored at rest within the platform itself. How about SIP credentials for devices or webRTC clients that you want to be allow to register with the platform and make phone calls? Sure, we allow all of that but we don't store the credentials -- you do. We never store any SIP credentials that could be hacked or used by others to run up your bill. d) white-labelable . Is that even a word? Well, in any case, jambonz is service-provider friendly -- it can operate in a multi-tenant configuration for service providers that want to provide a hosted service for customers who are interested in enjoying the privacy and other features of jambonz without running their own hardware. Who should be interested? Those interested would include: customers that want to save costs vs a commercial CPAAS by using their own sip trunks rather than paying more expensive per-minute rates to a CPAAS provider. customers that need to achieve stringent data privacy requirements and wish to avoid exposing their customers' sensitive data to third parties that they can't effectively audit. customers that want greater control and the ability to add features themselves to their CPAAS platform. enterprises with highly capable IT departments that are already managing most of what is required for a hosted telephony solution (e.g. cloud storage, speech APIs, infrastructure as code, etc) and are starting to wonder why they are paying so much money to a third party for doing the same thing for them. service providers that want a white-label product that they can to offer as a branded solution to their customers. What is a jambonz application? Well, if you are using one of those fancy-pants CPAAS services, then you are already familiar with how this works: A jambonz application controls calls via web callbacks and an HTTP API. The jambonz platform notifies your application of incoming calls and call status changes via web callbacks. Your application provides call control instructions by responding to web callbacks with JSON payloads that include instructions, or by invoking a REST API . Additionally, jambonz supports sip end-user devices and webRTC clients registering with the platform and making and receiving calls. Come on people. We can do this thing! Take the next step, and read on to review our APIs.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-jambonz-api-documentation","text":"jambonz is an open source CPAAS project brought to you by the same people that brought you drachtio , the open source project for creating SIP server applications.

These messages are sent from your application in response to web callbacks from a jambonz call control server, and they provide jambonz with your instructions on how to handle a call. When an incoming call is received by the platform, jambonz makes an HTTP request to the URL endpoint that is configured for that called number. Outbound calls that are initiated by the REST API are controlled in a similar way -- when invoking the REST API to launch a call, you provide a web callback url and in your response to the subsequent HTTP GET or POST to that url you then return a JSON payload describing the application that should govern the outbound call. Basic JSON message structure The JSON payload (aka the \"application\") that you provide in response to a callback must be an array of objects, with each object describing a task that the platform shall perform. These tasks are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array. Each task is identified by a verb (e.g. \"dial\", \"gather\", \"hangup\" etc) with associated detail and these verbs are described in more detail below. If the caller hangs up during the execution of an application for that call, the current task is allowed to complete and any remaining tasks in the application are ignored. Through additional callbacks that may be invoked during the execution of an application (typically as a result of those verbs which have an \"action\" property callback), the current application may be replaced with a new JSON application document. In such a case, the new document begins executing, and any remaining tasks in the original document are discarded. Each task object in the JSON array must include a \"verb\" property that describes the action to take. Any additional information that the task needs to operate are provided as properties as well, e.g.: { verb : say , text : Hi there! Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly. , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-C } } Some verbs allow other verbs to be nested; e.g. \"gather\" can have a nested \"say\" command in order to play a prompt and collect a response in one command: { verb : gather , action : https://00dd977a.ngrok.io/gather , input : [ speech , dtmf ], timeout : 16, numDigits : 6, recognizer : { vendor : google , language : en-US }, say : { text : Please say or enter your six digit card number now , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-C } } } Altogether then, a simple example application which provides the basics of a voicemail application with transcription would look like this: [ { verb : say , text : Hi there! Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly. Thanks, and have a great day! }, { verb : listen , action : http://example.com/voicemail , url : http://ws.example.com , finishOnKey : # , metadata : { topic : voicemail }, mixType : mono , playBeep : true, timeout : 20, transcribe : { transcriptionCallback : http://example.com/transcription } }, { verb : say , text : Thanks for your message. We'll get back to you } ] Hey, did you see what we did there? It's a voicemail application, but where is the recording url? How do you retrieve the recording after the call? There is none, and you don't. Let's rethink this: Instead of making a recording -- which exposes your customer's PII since we now have to store sensitive data at rest in the platform -- how's about we instead send you a real-time audio stream over a secure websocket connection while the call is proceeding. Annotate it with any metadata you need for tracking on your end, and we'll send that along as well. Thus, you get the audio in real-time and we don't ever store your customer's sensitive data at rest. Bam. Done. HTTP connection details Each HTTP request that jambonz makes to one of your callbacks will include (at least) the following information either as query arguments (in a GET request) or in the body of the response as a JSON payload (in a POST request): callSid: a unique identifier for the call, in a uuid format. applicationSid: a unique identifier for the jambonz application controlling this call accountSid: a unique identifier for the jambonz account associated with the application direction: the direction of the call, either 'inbound' or 'outbound' from: the calling party number to: the called party number callerId: the caller name, if known callStatus: current status of the call, see table below sipStatus: the most recent sip status code received or generated for the call Additionally, the request MAY include parentCallSid: the callSid of a parent call to this call, if this call is a child call And the initial webhook for a new incoming call will have: originatingSipTrunkName: name of the SIP trunk that originated the call to the platform originatingSipIp: the ip address and port of the sip gateway that originated the call Finally, if you specify to use a POST method for the initial webhook for an incoming call, the JSON payload in that POST will also contain the entire incoming SIP INVITE request details in a 'sip' property (this is not provided if a GET request is used). This can be useful if you need a detailed look at all of the SIP headers or the Session Description Protocol being offered. Note also that the information that jambonz sends you with each HTTP request can be augmented by your application by using the tag verb. You may optionally use HTTP Basic Authentication to protect your endpoints. call status value description trying a new incoming call has arrived or an outbound call has just been sent ringing a 180 Ringing response has been sent or received early-media an early media connection has been established prior to answering the call (183 Session Progress) in-progress call has been answered completed an answered call has ended failed a call attempt failed busy a call attempt failed because the called party returned a busy status no-answer a call attempt failed because it was not answered in time Refer to the Example messages section to see further details. Initial state of incoming calls When the jambonz platform receives a new incoming call, it responds 100 Trying to the INVITE but does not automatically answer the call. It is up to your application to decide how to finally respond to the INVITE. You have some choices here. Your application can: answer the call, which connects the call to a media endpoint that can perform IVR functions on the call, outdial a new call, and bridge the two calls together (i.e use the dial verb), reject the call, with a specified SIP status code and reason, redirect the call (i.e. generating a SIP 302 response back to the caller), or establish an early media connection and play audio to the caller without answering the call. The last is interesting and worthy of further comment. The intent is to let you play audio to callers without necessarily answering the call. You signal this by including an \"earlyMedia\" property with a value of true in the application. When receiving this, the jambonz core will create an early media connection (183 Session Progress) if possible, as shown in the example below. Note: an early media connection will not be possible if the call has already been answered by an earlier verb in the application. In such a scenario, the earlyMedia property is ignored. [ { verb : say , earlyMedia : true, text : Please call back later, we are currently at lunch synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-F }, { verb : sip:decline , status : 480, headers : { Retry-After : 1800 } } } ] The say, play, gather, listen, and transcribe verbs all support the \"earlyMedia\" property. The dial verb supports a similar feature of not answering the inbound call unless/until the dialed call is answered via the \"answerOnBridge\" property. Speech integration The platform makes use of text-to-speech as well as real-time speech recognition. Currently, only google is supported for both text to speech and speech to text. Other speech vendors will be supported in the near future. A JSON service key file containing GCP credentials for cloud speech services must be downloaded and installed on the jambonz feature servers to enable tts and speech recognition. As part of the definition of an application, you can set defaults for the voice to use for speech synthesis as well as the language to use for speech recognition. These can then be overridden by verbs in the application, by using the 'synthesizer' and 'recognizer' properties Supported Verbs Each of the supported verbs are described below. dial The dial command is used to create a new call by dialing out to a number, a registered sip user, or sip endpoint. { verb : dial , action : /outdial , callerId : +16173331212 , answerOnBridge : true, dtmfCapture : [ *2 , *3 ], dtmfHook : { url : /dtmf }, target : [ { type : phone , number : +15083084809 }, { type : sip , sipUri : sip:1617333456@sip.trunk1.com , auth : { user : foo , password : bar } }, { type : user , name : spike@sip.example.com } ] } As the example above illustrates, when you execute the 'dial' command you are making one or more outbound call attempts in an effort to create one new call, which can be bridged to a parent call. The target property specifies an array of call destinations (aka endpoints ) that will be attempted simultaneously. If multiple endpoints are specified in the target array, all targets are outdialed at the same time (e.g., \"simring\", or \"blast outdial\" as some folks call it) and the call will be connected to the first endpoint that answers the call and, optionally, completes a call screening application as specified in the url property. There are four types of endpoints: a telephone phone number, a sip endpoint, identified by a sip uri, or a webrtc or sip client that has registered directly with your application, a parking slot You can use the following attributes in the dial command: option description required action URL of webhook to invoke when the call ends. The 'action' URL may be either an absolute or relative URL. If the latter, it is applied to the base URL of the original application, and if basic auth was used for the original request, then it will be for this request as well no answerOnBridge If set to true, the inbound call will ring until the number that was dialed answers the call, and at that point a 200 OK will be sent on the inbound leg. If false, the inbound call will be answered immediately as the outbound call is placed. Defaults to false. no callerId The inbound caller's phone number, which is displayed to the number that was dialed. The caller ID must be a valid E.164 number. Defaults to caller id on inbound call. no confirmMethod 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on 'confirmUrl' callback. no confirmUrl A specified URL for a document that runs on the callee's end after the dialed number answers but before the call is connected. This allows the caller to provide information to the dialed number, giving them the opportunity to decline the call, before they answer the call. Note that if you want to run different applications on specific destinations, you can specify the 'url' property on the nested target object. no dialMusic url that specifies a .wav or .mp3 audio file of custom audio or ringback to play to the caller while the outbound call is ringing. no dtmfCapture an array of strings that represent dtmf sequence which should trigger a mid-call notification to the application no dtmfHook a web callback to be invoked when a dtmfCapture entry is matched no headers an object containing arbitrary sip headers to apply to the outbound call attempt(s) no listen a nested listen action, which will cause audio from the call to be streamed to a remote server over a websocket connection no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on 'action' callback. Defaults to POST. no target array of to 10 destinations to simultaneously dial. The first person (or entity) to answer the call will be connected to the caller and the rest of the called numbers will be hung up. yes timeLimit max length of call in seconds no timeout ring no answer timeout, in seconds. Defaults to 60. no transcribe a nested transcribe action, which will cause the call to be transcribed no target types PSTN number option description required type must be \"phone\" yes url A specified URL for a document that runs on the callee's end after the dialed number answers but before the call is connected. This will override the confirmUrl property set on the parent dial verb, if any. no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on url callback. Defaults to POST. no number a telephone numnber in E.164 number yes sip endpoint option description required type must be \"sip\" yes url A specified URL for a document that runs on the callee's end after the dialed number answers but before the call is connected. This will override the confirmUrl property set on the parent dial verb, if any. no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on url callback. Defaults to POST. no sipUri sip uri to send call to yes auth authentication credentials no auth.user sip username no auth.password sip password no Using this approach, it is possible to send calls out a sip trunk. If the sip trunking provider enforces username/password authentication, then supply the credentials in the auth property. a registered webrtc or sip user option description required type must be \"user\" yes url A specified URL for a document that runs on the callee's end after the dialed number answers but before the call is connected. This will override the confirmUrl property set on the parent dial verb, if any. no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on url callback. Defaults to POST. no name registered sip user, including domain (e.g. \"joeb@sip.jambonz.org\") yes parking slot option description required type must be \"park\" yes slot the name of the parking slot yes Dialing to a parking slot allows you to pick up a call that has been parked in that slot. If the slot is empty, the dial verb will return immediate failure. The url property that can be optionally specified as part of the target types (with the exception of the park type) is a web callback that will be invoked when the outdial call is answered. That callback should return an application that will run on the outbound call before bridging it to the inbound call. If the application completes with the outbound call still in a stable/connected state, then the two calls will be bridged together. This allows you to easily implement call screening applications (e.g. \"You have a call from so-and-so. Press 1 to decline\"). gather The gather command is used to collect dtmf or speech input. { verb : gather , action : http://example.com/collect , input : [ digits , speech ], finishOnKey : # , numDigits : 5, timeout : 8, recognizer : { vendor : google , language : en-US }, say : { text : To speak to Sales press 1. To speak to customer support press 2. , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-F } } } You can use the following options in the gather command: option description required action URL of webhook to invoke collected digits or speech. The 'action' URL may be either an absolute or relative URL. If the latter, it is applied to the base URL of the original application, and if basic auth was used for the original request, then it will be for this request as well yes finishOnKey dmtf key that signals the end of input no input array, specifying allowed types of input: ['digits'], ['speech'], or ['digits', 'speech']. Default: ['digits'] no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on action callback. Defaults to POST. no numDigits number of dtmf digits expected to gather no partialResultCallback url to send interim transcription results to. Partial transcriptions are only generated if this property is set. no play nested play command that can be used to prompt the user no recognizer.hints array of words or phrases to assist speech detection no recognizer.language language code to use for speech detection. Defaults to the application level setting, or 'en-US' if not set no recognizer.profanityFilter if true, filter profanity from speech transcription. Default: no no recognizer.vendor speech vendor to use (currently only google supported) no say nested say command that can be used to prompt the user no timeout The number of seconds of silence or inaction that denote the end of caller input. The timeout timer will begin after any nested play or say command completes. Defaults to 5 no Note: an HTTP POST will be used for both the action and the partialResultCallback since the body may need to contain nested JSON objects for speech details. Note: the partialResultCallback web callback should not return content; any returned content will be discarded. hangup The hangup command terminates the call and ends the application. { verb : hangup , headers : { X-Reason : maximum call duration exceeded } } You can use the following options in the hangup action: option description required headers an object containing SIP headers to include in the BYE request no leave The leave verb transfers a call out of park. The call then returns to the flow of execution following the park verb that parked the call. { verb : leave } There are no options for the leave verb. listen jambonz does not have a 'record' verb. This is by design, for data privacy reasons. Recordings can contain sensitive and confidential information, and such data is never stored at rest in the jambonz core. Instead, jambonz provides the listen verb, where an audio stream(s) can be forked and sent in real-time to a customer application for processing. The listen verb can also be nested in a dial verb, which allows the audio for a call between two parties to be sent to a remote websocket server. To utilize the listen verb, the customer must implement a websocket server to receive and process the audio. The endpoint should be prepared to accept websocket connections with a subprotocol name of 'audio.jambonz.org'. The listen verb includes a url property which is the url of the remote websocket server to send the audio to. The url may be an absolute or relative URL. HTTP Basic Authentication can optionally be used to protect the websocket endpoint by using the wsAuth property. The format of the audio data sent over the websocket is 16-bit PCM encoding, with a user-specified sample rate. The audio is sent in binary frames over the websocket connection. Additionally, one text frame is sent immediately after the websocket connection is established. This text frame contains a JSON string with all of the call attributes normally sent on an HTTP request (e.g. callSid, etc), plus sampleRate and mixType properties describing the audio sample rate and stream(s). Additional metadata can also be added to this payload using the metadata property as described in the table below. Once the intial text frame containing the metadata has been sent, the remote side should expect to receive only binary frames, containing audio. The remote side is not expected to send any data back over the websocket. { verb : listen , url : wss://myrecorder.example.com/calls/271314e6-b463-4980-b007-80defc181058:4433 , mixType : stereo } You can use the following options in the listen action: option description required action URL of webhook to invoke when listen operation ends. The information will include the duration of the audio stream, and also a 'digits' property if the recording was terminated by a dtmf key. The 'action' URL may be either an absolute or relative URL. If the latter, it is applied to the base URL of the original application, and if basic auth was used for the original request, then it will be for this request as well yes auth.username HTTP basic auth username to use on action callback no auth.password HTTP basic auth password to use on action callback no finishOnKey The set of digits that can end the listen action no maxLength the maximum length of the listened audio stream, in secs no metadata arbitrary data to add to the JSON payload sent to the remote server when websocket connection is first connected no method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on action callback. Defaults to POST. no mixType \"mono\" (send single channel), \"stereo\" (send dual channel of both calls in a bridge), or \"mixed\" (send audio from both calls in a bridge in a single mixed audio stream) Default: mono no playBeep true, false whether to play a beep at the start of the listen operation. Default: false no sampleRate sample rate of audio to send (allowable values: 8000, 16000, 24000, 48000, or 64000). Default: 8000 no timeout the number of seconds of silence that terminates the listen operation. no transcribe a nested transcribe verb no url url of remote server to connect to yes wsAuth.username HTTP basic auth username to use on websocket connection no wsAuth.password HTTP basic auth password to use on websocket connection no park The park command is used to park a call at a named parking slot. Once a call is parked, it can be picked up by another call using the dial verb with a target type of 'park'. The park verb completes when one of the following happens: It is picked up by another caller, using the dial verb (and that call subsequently completes). It leaves the parking slot due to executing a leave verb. It leaves the parking slot due to a timeout. The caller hangs up. Once the park command completes, it optionally calls a configured action parameter (unless the caller has hung up) and executes the application returned, if any. If no action is specified, it proceeds to execute the next task in the current application. { verb : park , slot : 7000 , action : { url : /unparked }, waitHook : { url : /while-parked }, timeout : 60 } You can use the following options in the park command: option description required action a webhook that is invoked when the call leaves the parking slot. If the call has been bridged to another party, the webhook is invoked when that call is complete.

The returned task list may only include play, say, or gather verbs. Once the task list is completed, the webhook will be called again repeatedly while the call is parked no The action request includes the standard request parameters, plus the following: property description parkOutcome the result of the park command, as described below slot the parking slot used parkTime the number of seconds the call was parked The parkOutcome is one of the following: value description 'bridged' The parked call was picked up 'abandoned' The call was abandoned in park 'left' the call left the parking slot due to a leave command 'timeout' the call left the parking slot due to a timeout pause The pause command waits silently for a specified number of seconds. { verb : pause , length : 3 } You can use the following options in the pause action: option description required length number of seconds to wait before continuing the app yes play The play command is used to stream recorded audio to a call. { verb : play , url : https://example.com/example.mp3 } You can use the following options in the play action: option description required url a single url or array of urls (will play in sequence) to a wav or mp3 file yes loop number of times to play the url(s) no (default: 1) earlyMedia if true and the call has not yet been answered, play the audio without answering call.

All actions after redirect are unreachable and ignored. { verb : redirect , action : https://example.com/?foo=bar , method : GET , auth : { username : foo , password : bar } } You can use the following options in the redirect action: option description required action URL of webhook to retrieve document from. The 'action' URL may be either an absolute or relative URL. If the latter, it is applied to the base URL of the original application, and if basic auth was used for the original request, then it will be for this request as well yes method 'GET', 'POST' - http method to use on url callback. Defaults to POST. no auth.user HTTP Basic Authorization username no auth.password HTTP Basic Authorization password no say The say command is used to send synthesized speech to the remote party. The text provided may be either plain text or may use SSML tags. { verb : say , text : hi there! , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-AU-Wavenet-B } } You can use the following options in the say action: option description required text text to speak; may contain SSML tags yes synthesizer.vendor speech vendor to use (currently only google supported) no synthesizer.voice voice to use.

Defaults to false no sip:decline The sip:decline action is used to reject an incoming call with a specific status and, optionally, a reason and SIP headers to include on the response. This action must be the first and only action returned in the JSON payload for an incoming call. The sip:decline action is a non-blocking action and the session ends immediately after the action is executed. { verb : sip:decline , status : 480, reason : Gone Fishing , headers : { Retry-After : 1800 } } You can use the following options in the sip:decline action: option description required status a valid SIP status code in the range 4XX - 6XX yes reason a brief description no (default: the well-known SIP reasons associated with the specified status code headers SIP headers to include in the response no sip:notify The sip:notify action is used to a SIP NOTIFY request to one or more registered users. The sip:notify action is a non-blocking action. { verb : sip:notify , user : [ spike ], contentType : application/simple-message-summary , content : [ Messages-Waiting: yes , Message-Account: sip:spike@sip.example.com , Voice-Message: 2/8 (0/2) ], headers : { Subscription-State : active } } You can use the following options in the sip:notify action: option description required user user, or array of users, to send NOTIFY requests to yes contentType value of SIP Content-Type header in NOTIFY yes content body of NOTIFY request yes headers object specifying arbitrary headers to apply to SIP NOTIFY request no Note : the sip:notify verb is not currently implemented. sip:redirect The sip:redirect command is used to redirect an incoming call to another sip server or network. This must be the first and only command returned in the web callback for an incoming call. A SIP 302 Moved response will be sent back to the caller. The sip:redirect command is a non-blocking and the session ends immediately after the command is executed. { verb : sip:redirect , sipUri : sip:123@gateway.example.com } You can use the following options in the sip:decline command: option description required sipUri a sip uri that will appear in the Contact header of the 302 response to the caller yes Note : the sip:redirect verb is not currently implemented. tag The tag verb is used to add properties to the standard call attributes that jambonz includes on every action or call status HTTP POST request. Note: because of the possible richness of the data, only subsequent POST requests will include this data. It will not be included in HTTP GET requests. The purpose is to simplify applications by eliminating the need to store state information if it can simply be echoed back to the application on each HTTP request for the call. For example, consider an application that wishes to apply some privacy settings on outdials based on attributes in the initial incoming call. The application could parse information from the SIP INVITE provided in the web callback when the call arrives, and rather than having to store that information for later use it could simply use the 'tag' verb to associate that information with the call. Later, when an action or call status triggers the need for the application to outdial it can simply access the information from the HTTP POST body, rather than having to retrieve it from the cache of some sort. Note that every time the tag verb is used, the collection of customer data is completely replaced with the new data provided. This information will be provided back in all action or status notifications if POST method is used. It will appear in property named 'customerData' in the JSON payload. { verb : tag , data { foo : bar , counter : 100, list : [1, 2, three ] } } After the above 'tag' verb has executed, web callbacks using POST would have a payload similar to this: { callSid : df09e8d4-7ffd-492b-94d9-51a60318552c , direction : inbound , from : +15083084809 , to : +15083728299 , callId : f0414693-bdb6-1238-6185-06d91d68c9b0 , sipStatus : 200, callStatus : in-progress , callerId : f0414693-bdb6-1238-6185-06d91d68c9b0 , accountSid : fef61e75-cec3-496c-a7bc-8368e4d02a04 , applicationSid : 0e0681b0-d49f-4fb8-b973-b5a3c6758de1 , originatingSipIp : 54.172.60.1:5060 , originatingSipTrunkName : twilio , customerData : { foo : bar , counter : 100, list : [1, 2, three ] } } You can use the following options in the tag command: option description required data a JSON object containing values to be saved and included in future action or call status notifications (HTTP POST only) for this call yes transcribe The transcribe verb is used to send real time transcriptions of speech to a web callback. The transcribe command is only allowed as a nested verb within a dial or listen verb. Using transcribe in a dial command allows a long-running transcription of a phone call to be made, while nesting within a listen verb allows transcriptions of recorded messages (e.g. voicemail). { verb : transcribe , transcriptionCallback : http://example.com/transcribe , recognizer : { vendor : google , language : en-US , interim : true } } You can use the following options in the transcribe command: option description required recognizer.dualChannel if true, transcribe the parent call as well as the child call no recognizer.interim if true interim transcriptions are sent no (default: false) recognizer.language language to use for speech transcription yes recognizer.profanityFilter if true, filter profanity from speech transcription. Default: no no recognizer.vendor speech vendor to use (currently only google supported) no transcriptionCallback url to invoke with transcriptions. An HTTP POST will be sent to this url. yes Note : the dualChannel property is not currently implemented.

These messages are sent from your application in response to web callbacks from a jambonz call control server, and they provide jambonz with your instructions on how to handle a call. When an incoming call is received by the platform, jambonz makes an HTTP request to the URL endpoint that is configured for that called number. Outbound calls that are initiated by the REST API are controlled in a similar way -- when invoking the REST API to launch a call, you provide a web callback url and in your response to the subsequent HTTP GET or POST to that url you then return a JSON payload describing the application that should govern the outbound call.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"jambonz/#basic-json-message-structure","text":"The JSON payload (aka the \"application\") that you provide in response to a callback must be an array of objects, with each object describing a task that the platform shall perform. These tasks are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array. Each task is identified by a verb (e.g. \"dial\", \"gather\", \"hangup\" etc) with associated detail and these verbs are described in more detail below. If the caller hangs up during the execution of an application for that call, the current task is allowed to complete and any remaining tasks in the application are ignored. Through additional callbacks that may be invoked during the execution of an application (typically as a result of those verbs which have an \"action\" property callback), the current application may be replaced with a new JSON application document. In such a case, the new document begins executing, and any remaining tasks in the original document are discarded. Each task object in the JSON array must include a \"verb\" property that describes the action to take. Any additional information that the task needs to operate are provided as properties as well, e.g.: { verb : say , text : Hi there! Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly. , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-C } } Some verbs allow other verbs to be nested; e.g. \"gather\" can have a nested \"say\" command in order to play a prompt and collect a response in one command: { verb : gather , action : https://00dd977a.ngrok.io/gather , input : [ speech , dtmf ], timeout : 16, numDigits : 6, recognizer : { vendor : google , language : en-US }, say : { text : Please say or enter your six digit card number now , synthesizer : { vendor : google , voice : en-US-Wavenet-C } } } Altogether then, a simple example application which provides the basics of a voicemail application with transcription would look like this: [ { verb : say , text : Hi there! Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly. Thanks, and have a great day! }, { verb : listen , action : http://example.com/voicemail , url : http://ws.example.com , finishOnKey : # , metadata : { topic : voicemail }, mixType : mono , playBeep : true, timeout : 20, transcribe : { transcriptionCallback : http://example.com/transcription } }, { verb : say , text : Thanks for your message. We'll get back to you } ] Hey, did you see what we did there? It's a voicemail application, but where is the recording url? How do you retrieve the recording after the call? There is none, and you don't. Let's rethink this: Instead of making a recording -- which exposes your customer's PII since we now have to store sensitive data at rest in the platform -- how's about we instead send you a real-time audio stream over a secure websocket connection while the call is proceeding. Annotate it with any metadata you need for tracking on your end, and we'll send that along as well. Thus, you get the audio in real-time and we don't ever store your customer's sensitive data at rest. Bam.

It is up to your application to decide how to finally respond to the INVITE. You have some choices here. Your application can: answer the call, which connects the call to a media endpoint that can perform IVR functions on the call, outdial a new call, and bridge the two calls together (i.e use the dial verb), reject the call, with a specified SIP status code and reason, redirect the call (i.e. generating a SIP 302 response back to the caller), or establish an early media connection and play audio to the caller without answering the call. The last is interesting and worthy of further comment. The intent is to let you play audio to callers without necessarily answering the call. You signal this by including an \"earlyMedia\" property with a value of true in the application. When receiving this, the jambonz core will create an early media connection (183 Session Progress) if possible, as shown in the example below. Note: an early media connection will not be possible if the call has already been answered by an earlier verb in the application. In such a scenario, the earlyMedia property is ignored.

The target property specifies an array of call destinations (aka endpoints ) that will be attempted simultaneously. If multiple endpoints are specified in the target array, all targets are outdialed at the same time (e.g., \"simring\", or \"blast outdial\" as some folks call it) and the call will be connected to the first endpoint that answers the call and, optionally, completes a call screening application as specified in the url property.

This is by design, for data privacy reasons. Recordings can contain sensitive and confidential information, and such data is never stored at rest in the jambonz core. Instead, jambonz provides the listen verb, where an audio stream(s) can be forked and sent in real-time to a customer application for processing. The listen verb can also be nested in a dial verb, which allows the audio for a call between two parties to be sent to a remote websocket server. To utilize the listen verb, the customer must implement a websocket server to receive and process the audio. The endpoint should be prepared to accept websocket connections with a subprotocol name of 'audio.jambonz.org'. The listen verb includes a url property which is the url of the remote websocket server to send the audio to. The url may be an absolute or relative URL. HTTP Basic Authentication can optionally be used to protect the websocket endpoint by using the wsAuth property. The format of the audio data sent over the websocket is 16-bit PCM encoding, with a user-specified sample rate. The audio is sent in binary frames over the websocket connection. Additionally, one text frame is sent immediately after the websocket connection is established. This text frame contains a JSON string with all of the call attributes normally sent on an HTTP request (e.g. callSid, etc), plus sampleRate and mixType properties describing the audio sample rate and stream(s). Additional metadata can also be added to this payload using the metadata property as described in the table below. Once the intial text frame containing the metadata has been sent, the remote side should expect to receive only binary frames, containing audio. The remote side is not expected to send any data back over the websocket. { verb : listen , url : wss://myrecorder.example.com/calls/271314e6-b463-4980-b007-80defc181058:4433 , mixType : stereo } You can use the following options in the listen action: option description required action URL of webhook to invoke when listen operation ends.

Note: because of the possible richness of the data, only subsequent POST requests will include this data. It will not be included in HTTP GET requests. The purpose is to simplify applications by eliminating the need to store state information if it can simply be echoed back to the application on each HTTP request for the call. For example, consider an application that wishes to apply some privacy settings on outdials based on attributes in the initial incoming call. The application could parse information from the SIP INVITE provided in the web callback when the call arrives, and rather than having to store that information for later use it could simply use the 'tag' verb to associate that information with the call. Later, when an action or call status triggers the need for the application to outdial it can simply access the information from the HTTP POST body, rather than having to retrieve it from the cache of some sort.

Inbound calls are those made from external numbers or devices towards the platform, while outbound calls are placed by the platform to an endpoint. Inbound calls quite often are used to trigger outbound calls and in such a situation the outbound call will have a Parent Call Sid that references the inbound call. Calls may created, modified, and deleted through the API. Create a Call Calls are created from the REST API by sending an HTTP POST request. A successful HTTP 201 response will contain the Call Sid of the call attempt that has been launched.

Api keys can be created and destroyed via the API. API keys can have different scopes: Admin scope, service provider scope, and account scope. Admin scope allows the bearer to make changes to global system properties and to create Service Providers. Service provider scope allows the bearer to create and manage Accounts under the Service Providerxs. Account scope allows the bearer to create applications and calls associated with the Account. Conference participants Conference participants refer to calls that are actively connected to a conference. You can mute or remove participants from a conference as well as retrieve a list of all participants, along with detailed information about each participant, in an active conference. Conferences Conferences represent a common endpoint that can mix the audio from multiple calls. Conferences can be created, modified and deleted through the API. Phone numbers Phone numbers represent phone numbers that route to the jambonz platform, and may be associated with an application. A Phone number may be associated with zero or one Application. Phone numbers can be created and destroyed through the API, as well as being modified to point to a different application. Queues Queues represent an ordered collection of active calls that are parked (not connected to a far end). Queues may be created and deleted through the API. Queued calls Queued calls are calls that have been assigned to a queue.","title":"REST API"},{"location":"rest/#overview","text":"The jambonz REST API allows applications to query, create, and manage calls and other resources. Base URL All calls should use the following base URL: https://{serviceUrl}/v1 where serviceUrl is set according to your own installation.
