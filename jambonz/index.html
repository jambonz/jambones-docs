                <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>jambones is a specification for issuing call control commands via JSON payloads over HTTP connections.  These messages are sent from your application in response to web callbacks from a jambones call control server, and they provide jambones with your instructions on how to handle a call.  </p>
<p>When an incoming call is received by the platform, jambones makes an HTTP request to the URL endpoint that is configured for that called number. Outbound calls that are initiated by the REST API are controlled in a similar way -- when invoking the REST API to launch a call, you provide a web callback url and in your response to the subsequent HTTP GET or POST to that url you then return a JSON payload describing the application that should govern the outbound call.</p>
<h2 id="basic-json-message-structure">Basic JSON message structure</h2>
<p>The JSON payload (aka the "application") that you provide in response to a callback must be an array of objects, with each object describing a task that the platform shall perform.  These tasks are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array.  Each task is identified by a verb (e.g. "dial", "gather", "hangup" etc) with associated detail and these verbs are described in more detail below.</p>
<p>If the caller hangs up during the execution of an application for that call, the current task is allowed to complete and any remaining tasks in the application are ignored.</p>
<p>Through additional callbacks that may be invoked during the execution of an application (typically as a result of those verbs which have an "action" property callback), the current application may be replaced with a new JSON application document.  In such a case, the new document begins executing, and any remaining tasks in the original document are discarded.</p>
<p>Each task object in the JSON array must include a "verb" property that describes the action to take.  Any additional information that the task needs to operate are provided as properties as well, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
  &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly.&quot;,
  &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
    &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
    &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;en-US-Wavenet-C&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some verbs allow other verbs to be nested; e.g. "gather" can have a nested "say" command in order to play a prompt and collect a response in one command:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;gather&quot;,
  &quot;action&quot;: &quot;https://00dd977a.ngrok.io/gather&quot;,
  &quot;input&quot;: [&quot;speech&quot;, &quot;dtmf&quot;],
  &quot;timeout&quot;: 16,
  &quot;numDigits&quot;: 6,
  &quot;recognizer&quot;: {
    &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
    &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;
  },
  &quot;say&quot;: {
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please say or enter your six digit card number now&quot;,
    &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
      &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
      &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;en-US-Wavenet-C&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Altogether then, a simple example application which provides the basics of a voicemail application with transcription would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly.  Thanks, and have a great day!&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;listen&quot;,
    &quot;action&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/voicemail&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://ws.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;finishOnKey&quot;: &quot;#&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
      &quot;topic&quot;: &quot;voicemail&quot;
    },
    &quot;mixType&quot;: &quot;mono&quot;,
    &quot;playBeep&quot;: true,
    &quot;timeout&quot;: 20,
    &quot;transcribe&quot;: {
      &quot;transcriptionCallback&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/transcription&quot;
    }
  },
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Thanks for your message.  We'll get back to you&quot;
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Hey, did you see what we did there?  It's a voicemail application, but where is the recording url?  How do you retrieve the recording after the call?</p>
<p>There is none, and you don't.</p>
<p>Let's rethink this: </p>
<p>Instead of making a recording -- which exposes your customer's PII since we now have to store sensitive data at rest in the platform -- how's about we instead send you a real-time audio stream over a websocket connection while the call is proceeding.  Annotate it with any metadata you need for tracking on your end, and we'll send that along as well.</p>
<p>Thus, you get the audio in real-time and we don't ever store your customer's sensitive data at rest.  Bam. Done.</p>
<h2 id="http-connection-details">HTTP connection details</h2>
<p>Each HTTP request that jambones makes to one of your callbacks will include (at least) the following query parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>callSid: a unique identifier for the call, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">uuid</a> format.</li>
<li>applicationSid: a unique identifier for the jambones application controlling this call</li>
<li>accountSid: a unique identifier for the jambones account associated with the application</li>
<li>direction: the direction of the call, either 'inbound' or 'outbound'</li>
<li>from: the calling party number</li>
<li>to: the called party number</li>
<li>callerId: the caller name, if known</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the request <strong>MAY</strong> include</p>
<ul>
<li>parentCallSid: the callSid of a parent call to this call, if this call is a child call</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the initial HTTP request to retrieve the application for a new incoming call will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>originatingSipTrunkName: name of the SIP trunk that originated the call to the platform</li>
<li>originatingSipIP: the ip address and port of the sip gateway that originated the call</li>
</ul>
<p>and a call status notification for an outbound call to a phone number will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminatingSipTrunkName: name of the SIP trunk that terminated the call to the PSTN</li>
<li>terminatingSipIP: the ip address (or DNS name) and port of the sip gateway that terminated the call</li>
</ul>
<p>The HTTP request may be either a GET or a POST, generally depending on your specified preference, although in some cases a POST is always used due to the richness of the data being sent.</p>
<p>You may optionally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</a> to protect your endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="initial-state-of-incoming-calls">Initial state of incoming calls</h2>
<p>When the jambones platform receives a new incoming call, it responds 100 Trying to the INVITE but does not automatically answer the call.  It is up to your application to decide how to finally respond to the INVITE.  Your application can:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer the call, which connects the call to a media endpoint that can perform IVR functions on the call,</li>
<li>outdial a new call, and bridge the two calls together, </li>
<li>reject the call, with a specified SIP status code and reason,</li>
<li>redirect the call (i.e. generating a SIP 302 response), or</li>
<li>establish an early media connection without answering the call.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last is interesting and worthy of further comment.  The intent is to let you play audio to callers without necessarily answering the call.  You signal this by including an "earlyMedia" property with a value of true in the application.  When receiving this, the jambones core will create an early media connection (183 Session Progress) if possible, as shown in the example below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: an early media connection will not be possible if the call has already been answered by an earlier verb in the application.  In such a scenario, the earlyMedia property is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;earlyMedia&quot;: true,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please call back later, we are currently at lunch&quot;
    &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
      &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
      &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;en-US-Wavenet-F&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;sip:decline&quot;,
      &quot;status&quot;: 480,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Retry-After&quot;: 1800
      }
    }
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>The say, play, gather, listen, and transcribe verbs all support the "earlyMedia" property.  </p>
<p>The dial verb supports a similar feature of not answering the inbound call unless/until the dialed call is answered via the "answerOnBridge" property.</p>
<h2 id="speech-integration">Speech integration</h2>
<p>The platform makes use of text-to-speech as well as real-time speech recognition.  Currently, only google is supported for both text to speech and speech to text.  Other speech vendors will be supported in the future.</p>
<p>A JSON service key file containing GCP credentials for cloud speech services must be downloaded and installed on the jambones feature servers to enable tts and speech recognition.</p>
<p>As part of the definition of an application, you can set defaults for the voice to use for speech synthesis as well as the language to use for speech recognition.  These can then be overridden by verbs in the application, by using the 'synthesizer' and 'recognizer' properties</p>
<h1 id="supported-verbs">Supported Verbs</h1>
<p>Each of the supported verbs are described below.</p>
<h2 id="dial">dial</h2>
<p>The dial command is used to create a new call by dialing out to a number, a registered sip user, or sip endpoint.  </p>
<pre><code class="json">{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;dial&quot;,
  &quot;action&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/outdial&quot;,

  &quot;answerOnBridge&quot;: true,

        &quot;password&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;
      }
    },
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;spike@sip.example.com&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>As the example above illustrates, when you execute the 'dial' command you are making one or more outbound call attempts in an effort to create one new call, which can be bridged to a parent call. The <code>target</code> property specifies an array of call destinations (aka <a href="#target-types">endpoints</a>) that will be attempted simultaneously.  </p>
<p>If multiple endpoints are specified in the <code>target</code> array, all targets are outdialed at the same time (e.g., "simring", or "blast outdial" as some folks call it) and the call will be connected to the first endpoint that answers the call and, optionally, completes a call screening application as specified in the <code>url</code> property.</p>
<p>There are three types of endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>a telephone phone number,</li>
<li>a sip endpoint, identified by a sip uri, or</li>
<li>a webrtc or sip client that has registered directly with your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the following attributes in the <code>dial</code> command:</p>

<p>The <code>url</code> property that can be optionally specified as part of a target is a web callback that will be invoked when the outdial call is answered.  That callback should return an application that will run on the outbound call before bridging it to the inbound call.  If the application completes with the outbound call still in a stable/connected state, then the two calls will be bridged together.</p>
<p>This allows you to easily implement call screening applications (e.g. "You have a call from so-and-so.  Press 1 to decline").</p>

<h2 id="listen">listen</h2>
<p>jambones does not have a 'record' verb.    This is by design, for data privacy reasons.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Recordings can contain sensitive and confidential information, and such data is never stored at rest in the jambones core.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, jambones provides the 'listen' verb, where an audio stream(s) can be forked and sent in real-time to a customer application for processing.</p>
<p>The listen verb includes a <code>url</code> property which is the remote url of a websocket server to send the audio to. The audio format is 16-bit PCM encoding, with a user-specified sample rate.  The audio is sent in binary frames over the websocket connection.  Optionally, text frames can be sent as well -- these are used to send user-specified metadata at the start of the call, and DTMF entries during the call.</p>
<p>To utilize the listen verb, the customer must implement a websocket server to receive and process the audio.  The endpoint should be prepared to accept websocket connections with a subprotocol name of audio.drachtio.org.  </p>
<p>(<em>TBD: link for more detail on the protocol, json metadata etc</em>)</p>
<p>The listen verb can also be nested in a <a href="#dial">dial</a> verb, which allows the audio for a call between two parties to be sent to a remote websocket server.</p>
